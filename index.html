        <p> Hello, it is me, Audrey. I am a 19 year old sophmore currently enrolled in BFA DT. I am thrilled to be enrolled in this class as I have been increasingly interested in web development in creating something fresh, unique and entertaining. I am also interested in 3D modelling and digital design. </p>
